The main intention of this project is to explore the capabilities of [three.js](https://threejs.org/). Three.js is a JavaScript library which uses WebGL to perform heavy animations over your web browser. I'm using it for seamless animation to better represent my self on my portfolio. Although I'm not very much into graphic designing and animation but, three.js takes care of most of those stuff for me.

## How to use

The project was build with [`vite 2.6.0`](https://vitejs.dev/) package manager

### Installation Dependencies

### Steps

> Vite has a functionality to perform hot reload. That means any time you have made any changes to the code, by saving the file the page will reload automatically.

## Documentation

The documentation might not be in much depth but I'm sure the code itself is pretty self explanatory. I've tried using all the industry standard semantics and code organization.
